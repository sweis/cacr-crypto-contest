# CACR Cryptographic Algorithm Design Competition Results

This is a mirror of some of the submissions from the Chinese Association for Cryptologic Research (CACR) 
[Cryptographic Algorithm Design Competition](https://sfjs.cacrnet.org.cn/site/content/309.html) which [concluded in 2020](https://www.cacrnet.org.cn/site/content/854.html). The public key schemes seem to be intended to be post-quantum secure.
